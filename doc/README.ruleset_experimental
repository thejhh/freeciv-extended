                   Experimental Freeciv Ruleset
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This ruleset tries to use the new features available since freeciv 2.2. It
is based on the default ruleset. The changes can be extracted by

#> diff -ur data/default/ data/experimental/

If the changes in this ruleset result in a working game (especially with
regard to the AI) they could be included in the default ruleset for next
major release.

If you change the experimental ruleset, please include a short comment in
this file.



1. Changes compared to the default ruleset
   ---------------------------------------

- Plagues are activated. Temples, Aqueducts, Sewer Systems reduce the
  chance of plague in a city, as do the new Hospital and Genetic Laboratory
  buildings. The effect of Aqueducts is reduced after Industrialization
  is discovered. Building the wonder 'Cure for Cancer' further reduces
  the possibility of plague for your entire empire.

- The Genetic Laboratory increases the food output by 25% if the city
  size exceeds 20.

- Migration is activated and locked by the ruleset. Migration effects for
  the different governments are defined; cities belonging to more
  representative governments are more attractive for cross-border migration.

- After The Corporation is researched, the upkeep for most modern military
  units (Riflemen onwards) is changed from shields to gold, and cities
  no longer maintain any such units for free, regardless of government.
  Gold upkeep for units is tallied empire-wide (unlike buildings), and if
  funds run out, random units are disbanded.

- A new unit class Big Land is introduced, comprising all "siege" units
  (Catapult, Cannon etc) and Freight. Units of this type are restricted
  to flat terrain and cannot move into difficult terrain such as hills
  and forest, unless roads are built.

- Triremes can move on rivers (but later ships cannot).

- Activate variable city radii:
    radius 1 (radius_sq =  2): start
    radius 2 (radius_sq =  5): city size 3
    radius 3 (radius_sq = 10): city size 10 + Railroad
    radius 4 (radius_sq = 17): city size 30 + Railroad + Mass Transit +
                               Super Highway
  The vision range of the city is adapted accordingly.

- The number of build slots for units is increased at radius 3 and 4.

- (Add and) Activate tech upkeep. Beyond a certain technology level, some
  bulbs are required to maintain your civilization's existing knowledge,
  and if not supplied, some techs may be lost. (However, technology is not
  lost in this way during periods of Anarchy.)

- Activate server setting 'foggedborders': your view of foreign borders is
  not updated if you can't currently see the territory.

- Activated 'techlost_recv' and 'techlost_donor': whenever technologies are
  transferred between civilizations, there is a small chance that each of
  the parties will forget the technology in question.



2. Use the new ruleset
   -------------------

To play a game with the experimental rules, start the server with:
       ./ser -r data/experimental.serv
or a single player game with
       ./freeciv-gtk2 -r data/experimental.serv
(and any other command-line arguments you normally use; depending on
how you have Freeciv installed you may have to give the installed
data directory path instead of "data")

Start the client normally.  The client must be network-compatible
(usually meaning the same or similar version) but otherwise nothing
special is needed.  (However some third-party rulesets may
potentially require special graphics to work properly, in which case
the client should have those graphics available and be started with
an appropriate '--tiles' argument.)

Note that the Freeciv AI might not play as well with rules other
than standard Freeciv.  The AI is supposed to understand and
utilize all sane rules variations, so please report any AI
failures so that they can be fixed.
