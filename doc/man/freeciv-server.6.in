.SH DESCRIPTION
Freeciv is a free turn-based multiplayer strategy game, in which each player
becomes the leader of a civilization, fighting to obtain the ultimate goal:
To become the greatest civilization.

Players of Civilization II\*R by Microprose\*R should feel at home, since one
aim of Freeciv is to have compatible rules. 

Freeciv is maintained by an international team of coders and enthusiasts, and is
easily one of the most fun and addictive network games out there!

This is the server program used to establish a Freeciv server - see also
.IR freeciv-client (6)
\&.

This manual page only lists the command line arguments. For details
of the directives necessary to configure
.B freeciv-server
see the Server Manual which can be found at
.UR @WIKI_URL@
the Freeciv website
.UE
as well as the documentation which is part of the Freeciv distribution.
.SH OPTIONS
The following options are accepted on the command line of the server. They may
not be combined; that is, "freeciv-server \-fp savegame.sav 5557" will not work,
instead you would need to enter "freeciv-server \-f savegame.sav \-p 5557". Most
options have a short form (single hyphen and single letter) and a long form
(double hyphen and a complete word); their effects are identical.
.TP
.BI "\-A \fIprotocol\fP, \-\-Announce \fIprotocol\fP"
Uses \fIprotocol\fP when announcing game in LAN.
Possible values for \fIprotocol\fP are:

\fBIPv4\fP

\fBIPv6\fP

\fBnone\fP

.TP
.BI "\-a \fIfilename\fP, \-\-auth \fIfilename\fP"
Enables server authentication and allows access to registered players only.
\fIfilename\fP contains details of the database to store authentication
information. (This file, and the database itself, can be set up with the
.I scripts/setup_auth_server.sh
shell script in the Freeciv distribution.)
.TP
.BI "\-b \fIaddress\fP, \-\-bind \fIaddress\fP"
Sets the \fIaddress\fP on which the server will listen for clients.
.TP
.BI "\-d \fIlevel_number\fP, \-\-debug \fIlevel_number\fP"
Sets the amount of debugging information to be logged in the file named by the
.I \-l
option. Acceptable values for the \fIlevel_number\fP are:

\fB0\fP    for fatal messages only.

\fB1\fP    for fatal and error messages.

\fB2\fP    for fatal, error and normal messages (default).

\fB3\fP    for fatal, error, normal, and verbose messages.

.TP
.BI "\-e, \-\-exit\-on\-end"
When a game ends, exit instead of restarting.
.TP
.BI "\-F [ \fIsignal_number\fP ], \-\-Fatal [ \fIsignal_number\fP ]"
Raise a custom signal on failed assertion.  If \fIsignal_number\fP is not
specified, then the ABRT signal will be used.
.TP
.BI "\-f \fIfilename\fP, \-\-file \fIfilename\fP"
Loads a saved game (\fIfilename\fP) into the server before initialization,
instead of starting a new game. This is for reloading saved games, or for 
loading scenarios. The directory where scenarios are searched for can be
changed with the
.I \-\-scenarios
option.
.TP
.BI "\-G, \-\-Guests"
Allow guests to login as 'guest' when authentication is enabled.
.TP
.BI "\-h, \-\-help"
Prints out a description of the command line options and exits.
.TP
.BI "\-i \fIaddress\fP, \-\-identity \fIaddress\fP"
Reports the \fIaddress\fP to the metaserver.  Then, the metaserver will use
this address to redirect the users.
.TP
.BI "\-l \fIfilename\fP, \-\-log \fIfilename\fP"
Defines a log file, \fIfilename\fP, to be produced during processing. Use the
.I \-d
option to set how much is logged.  By default, fatal, error, and normal
messages are printed to standard output.  With a log file, such messages go to
the log instead.
.TP
.BI "\-M \fIaddress\fP, \-\-Metaserver \fIaddress\fP"
Specifies the \fIaddress\fP of the metaserver to send your server's information
to. By default, the standard metaserver run by the Freeciv maintainers will
be used.
.TP
.BI "\-m, \-\-meta"
Directs the server to communicate with a metaserver, a place where Freeciv
servers can publish their presence. Freeciv clients consult the metaserver to
offer users a selection of games to join. By default the standard Freeciv 
metaserver is used. You may specify an alternate metaserver with the \fI\-M\fP
option.
.TP
.BI "\-N, \-\-Newusers"
Allow new users to login and be registered in the players base if authentication
is enabled.
.TP
.BI "\-p \fIport\fP, \-\-port \fIport\fP"
Specifies the TCP \fIport\fP number to which clients will connect; players must know
this number to be able to connect if they are not to use the default of 5556
decimal. You may need to use this if 5556 is not available for your use on your
system, or if you would like to run multiple servers on the same system.
.TP
.BI "\-P, \-\-Ppm"
Automatically save PPM files showing the map alongside autosaves.
.TP
.BI "\-q \fItime\fP, \-\-quitidle \fItime\fP"
Quits if no players are present for the specified \fItime\fP, in seconds, and 
restarts a new server.
.TP
.BI "\-R \fIfilename\fP, \-\-Ranklog \fIfilename\fP"
Defines a log file, \fIfilename\fP, to be produced during processing. This log
contains information for player ranking.
.TP
.BI "\-r \fIfilename\fP, \-\-read \fIfilename\fP"
Specifies a file, \fIfilename\fP, of server commands which the server will 
automatically read and process, as if you had typed them in at the server's 
prompt. The distribution comes with a few examples, including files that set
options to be similar to Civilization I\*R and Civilization II\*R . The files
are named \fIciv1.serv\fP and \fIciv2.serv\fP, and are typically found at 
\fI/usr/local/share/freeciv/\fP.
.TP
.BI "\-S \fIid\fP, \-\-Serverid \fIid\fP"
Sets the server \fIid\fP. This is used to identify a particular running game.
.TP
.BI "\-s \fIdirectory\fP, \-\-saves \fIdirectory\fP"
Specifies the \fIdirectory\fP to place save game files created by the server.
This is especially useful when you're running more than one server on the same
system, as it inhibits your servers from clobbering other's save game files.
.TP
.BI "\-\-scenarios \fIdirectory\fP"
Specifies the \fIdirectory\fP where scenarios are searched for.
The distribution comes with several scenarios, typically stored in
\fI/usr/local/share/freeciv/scenario\fP, for example:

.IP
\(bu
.I british\-isles\-85x80\-v2.80.sav

\(bu
.I earth\-160x90\-v2.sav

\(bu
.I earth\-80x50\-v3.sav

\(bu
.I europe\-200x100\-v2.sav

\(bu
.I hagworld\-120x60\-v1.2.sav

\(bu
.I iberian\-peninsula\-136x100\-v1.0.sav

.TP
.BI "\-v, \-\-version"
Causes the server to display its version number and exit.
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
.B freeciv-server \-\-file oldgame.sav \-\-port 2244
Starts a server on port \fI2244\fP, loading the save game file 
\fIoldgame.sav\fP.
.TP
.B freeciv-server \-R ranklog \-l logfile \-r script \-f oldgame.sav.gz -p 2244
Starts a server on port \fI2244\fP, loading the save game file 
\fIoldgame.sav.gz\fP. Ranking related events are written to \fIranklog\fP, other 
logging information is written to \fIlogfile\fP. When the server starts, it 
immediately executes the commands contained in \fIscript\fP.
.TP
.B freeciv-server -m -a fc_auth.conf -q 60 -p 2244 -d 2 -l logfile -r script -s ~/saves
Starts a server on port \fI2244\fP with authentication enabled and communicates 
its existence to the standard Freeciv metaserver. Fatal, error, and normal 
messages are written to \fIlogfile\fP. When the server starts it immediately 
executes the commands contained in \fIscript\fP. Save game files are stored in 
the \fI~/saves\fP directory. When there are no users on the server for \fI60\fP
seconds, the server will restart.
.SH COMMANDS
You may enter commands into the server at any time, either before or during the
running of a game. 

Type "help" or "help help" for starters.
.SH FILES
The Freeciv server requires the following files in the Freeciv data directory,
which is
.I /usr/local/share/freeciv
by default:

\(bu
.I default/buildings.ruleset

\(bu
.I default/cities.ruleset

\(bu
.I default/effects.ruleset

\(bu
.I default/game.ruleset

\(bu
.I default/governments.ruleset

\(bu
.I default/nations.ruleset

\(bu
.I default/techs.ruleset

\(bu
.I default/terrain.ruleset

\(bu
.I default/units.ruleset

\(bu
.I default/default.lua

\(bu
.I default/script.lua

These are the default rule sets used for the game. Alternate sets of rules can
be used by placing them in a separate directory and using the \fBrulesetdir\fP
command to change your server's ruleset directory. 

Type \fBhelp rulesetdir\fP for more information.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
The Freeciv server accepts these environment variables:
.TP
.BI FREECIV_CAPS
A string containing a list of "capabilities" provided by the server. The
compiled-in default should be correct for most purposes, but if you are familiar
with the capability facility in the source you may use it to enforce some
constraints between clients and server.
.TP
.BI FREECIV_COMPRESSION_LEVEL
Sets the compression level for network traffic.
.TP
.BI FREECIV_DATA_ENCODING
Sets the data encoding (used for data files, savegames, and network strings).
.TP
.BI FREECIV_INTERNAL_ENCODING
Sets the internal encoding (used for GUI strings).
.TP
.BI FREECIV_LOCAL_ENCODING
Sets the local encoding (used for terminal output).
.TP 
.BI FREECIV_MULTICAST_GROUP
Sets the multicast group (for the LAN tab).
.TP
.BI FREECIV_PATH
A colon separated list of directories pointing to the
.B freeciv
directory. By default freeciv looks in the following directories,
in order, for any data files: the current directory; the "data" subdirectory
of the current directory; the subdirectories ".freeciv" and
".freeciv/@DATASUBDIR@" in the user's home directory; and the directory where
the files are placed by running "make install".  This setting has no effect if
\fBFREECIV_DATA_PATH\fP, \fBFREECIV_SAVE_PATH\fP and
\fBFREECIV_SCENARIO_PATH\fP are defined together.
.TP
.BI FREECIV_SCENARIO_PATH
A colon separated list of directories pointing to the
.B freeciv
data directories. By default freeciv looks in the following directories,
in order, for any data files: the current directory; the "data" subdirectory
of the current directory; the subdirectory ".freeciv/@DATASUBDIR@" in the user's
home directory; and the directory where the files are placed by running
"make install".  If not set,
.BI FREECIV_PATH
is used instead.
.TP
.BI FREECIV_SAVE_PATH
A colon separated list of directories pointing to the
.B freeciv
save directories. By default freeciv looks in the following directories,
in order, for any data files: the current directory; and the subdirectory
".freeciv/saves" in the user's home directory.  If not set,
.BI FREECIV_PATH
is used instead, looking also in "saves" potential subdirectories.
.TP
.BI FREECIV_SCENARIO_PATH
A colon separated list of directories pointing to the
.B freeciv
data directories. By default freeciv looks in the following directories,
in order, for any data files: the current directory; the "data/scenario"
subdirectory of the current directory; the subdirectory ".freeciv/scenarios"
in the user's home directory; and the directory where the files are placed
by running "make install".  If not set,
.BI FREECIV_PATH
is used instead, looking also in "scenario" and "scenarios" potential
subdirectories.
.TP
.BI HOME
Specifies the user's home directory.
.TP
.BI http_proxy
Set this variable accordingly when using a proxy.
.TP
\fBLANG\fP  or  \fBLANGUAGE\fP
Sets the language and locale on some platforms.
.TP
\fBLC_ALL\fP  or  \fBLC_CTYPE\fP
