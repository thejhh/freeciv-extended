legend=_("The Nimiipuu, or the 'Real People', in their own language,\
 are better known as the 'Nez Perce'. This Native American nation\
 covered parts of Washington, Oregon, Montana and Idaho and consisted\
 of more than 70 permanent villages in 1800. At this time the population\
 numbered about 6,000. After a defeat by the American cavalry on October 5,\
 1877, the Nimiipuu were moved to reservations. The elected Nez Perce\
 Tribal Executive Committee now governs tribal affairs.")

; The Nez Perce was divided into several tribal groups, each with their
