legend=_("Comprising five states, variously described as chiefdoms\
 and kingdoms, the Mwiska (a.k.a. Muisca) likely numbered between\
 half a million to one million people at the time of Spanish conquest.\
 The two largest of the Mwiska states, Zipa and Zaque, were at\
 conflict with one another when the Spanish came on the scene, with\
 the former being more successful than the latter. Spanish conquest\
 was fairly quick, however, and no rebellion took place after 1541 and\
 the language went extinct in the 18th century.")
