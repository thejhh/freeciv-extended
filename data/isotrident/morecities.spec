;
; The names for city tiles are not free and must follow the following rules.
; The names consists of style name, _ , size. The style name is as specified
; in cities.ruleset file. The size indicates which size city must
; have to be drawn with a tile. E.g. european_4 means that the tile is to be
; used for cities of size 4+ in european style. Obviously the first tile
; must be style_name_0. The sizes must be in ascending order.
; There must also be a style_name_wall tile used to draw the wall and
; an occupied tile to indicate a miltary units in a city.
; The maximum size supported now is 31, but there can only be MAX_CITY_TILES
; normal tiles. The constant is defined in common/city.h and set to 8 now.
